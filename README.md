# 499-Solution

  This is my repository that holds the solution for my Capstone Project.

  It is a Java application that creates a Graphical User Interface(GUI) using the Swing Framework. 
As the point of this application is to be used without requiring internet access, the application translates by using a Comma Seperated Values File(CSV     file).
The CSV file has roughly 66 thousand words in it, with each line in the file conatining the english word and then the translated word in spanish.
The program will go through the file line by line filling out a HashMap that stores the english word as the key and the spanish word as the value.

## How to run the application

1. Download a [Java Development Kit(JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
   - It does not matter which version you have, either will allow you to run the .jar file 
2. Click the green button that says "Code" in the top right of the page
   - In the drop down menu, click the "Download ZIP"
   - Download it anywhere you can access files easily, preferably your Desktop
3. You can navigate to the .jar file by clicking through the folders at the top
   - If you click the top folder every time you will reach the folder "java"
4. Click the file called "TranslatorGUI" with a type "Executable Jar File" and Enjoy!!

  I have added in a link to Casa de Internet, a site that contains information about various internet development non profit orgranizations in Latin America. All of these organizations work to develop internet infrastructure and improve technological capabilities of communities in spanish speaking countries. Many of the organizations on Casa de Internet have spent more than twenty years working to expand, stabilize, and update internet access in Latin America.
