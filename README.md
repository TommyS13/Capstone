# 499-Solution

  This is my repository that holds the solution for my Capstone Project.

  It is a Java application that creates a Graphical User Interface(GUI) using the Swing Framework. 
As the point of this application is to be used without requiring internet access, the application translates by using a Comma Seperated Values File(CSV     file).
The CSV file has roughly 66 thousand words in it, with each line in the file conatining the english word and then the translated word in spanish.
The program will go through the file line by line filling out a HashMap that stores the english word as the key and the spanish word as the value.

  The application uses the Swing Framework to create the GUI.
The Swing Framework has the capabilities to create the panel, buttons, and textfields for the application.
There are two textfields, one for the english word which recieves input from the user and then one that outputs in spanish.
There are two buttons, one labeled "Translate" that upon pressing will take in the word from the english textfield and find the spanish translation from   the HashMap and output the spanish word to the spanish textfield. There is another button labeled "Clear" to clear both textfields.

To reach the java files and csv file, navigate to the Translator folder, and then the src/main folder. The next folder is called 499, within 499 is all     the java files. Running the application will require the user to download all the files, then compile the GUI.java file in the terminal or command line     using javac GUI.java then java GUI.

  I have added in a link to Casa de Internet, a site that contains information about various internet development non profit orgranizations in Latin America. All of these organizations work to develop internet infrastructure and improve technological capabilities of communities in spanish speaking countries. Many of the organizations on Casa de Internet have spent more than twenty years working to expand, stabilize, and update internet access in Latin America.
